## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.10 or higher
pip package manager
16GB+ RAM recommended for large dataset processing
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RiskGrid.git
cd RiskGrid
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download Chicago crime data
```bash
# Download from Chicago Data Portal or use provided script
python scripts/download_data.py
```

### Quick Start

1. **Preprocess the data**
```bash
python src/preprocessing/clean_data.py
```

2. **Engineer features**
```bash
python src/feature_engineering/create_features.py
```

3. **Train models**
```bash
python src/modeling/train_models.py
```

4. **Launch dashboard**
```bash
python dashboard/app.py
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000
```

## 📈 Feature Engineering

RiskGrid creates 60+ predictive features including:

**Temporal Features:**
- Hour of day, day of week, month, season
- Holiday indicators
- Time-based cyclical encoding

**Spatial Features:**
- Grid cell coordinates
- Neighborhood demographics
- Distance to landmarks (police stations, transit)
- Spatial lag analysis (neighboring cell crime rates)

**Historical Features:**
- Rolling crime counts (7-day, 30-day windows)
- Crime type distributions
- Arrest rate trends
- Temporal patterns per location

## 🧠 Model Architecture

RiskGrid employs an ensemble approach combining three powerful models:

1. **Random Forest**: Captures non-linear spatial relationships
2. **XGBoost**: Optimizes gradient boosting for temporal patterns
3. **LightGBM**: Handles large-scale data with efficient leaf-wise growth

The ensemble weights are optimized through cross-validation to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing false negatives.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The interactive web dashboard provides:

- **Risk Heat Map**: Real-time visualization of crime risk across the city
- **Temporal Analysis**: Hourly and daily crime pattern trends
- **Hotspot Identification**: Automatic detection of high-risk zones
- **Resource Allocation**: Suggested patrol routes and deployment strategies
- **Performance Metrics**: Live model accuracy and prediction confidence
- **Historical Comparison**: Actual vs predicted crime patterns

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Law Enforcement**: Optimize patrol routes and resource allocation
- **Urban Planning**: Identify areas needing infrastructure improvements
- **Policy Making**: Data-driven decision making for crime prevention
- **Community Safety**: Inform residents about neighborhood safety trends
- **Research**: Academic studies on crime patterns and prevention

## 📝 Data Sources

- 7.8+ million crime records (2001-present)
- Location coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Crime types and descriptions
- Arrest information
- Temporal metadata

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time data integration with city crime feeds
- [ ] LSTM/GRU models for time-series forecasting

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

RiskGrid is designed with ethical AI principles:

- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular audits for demographic fairness
- **Transparency**: Explainable predictions with feature importance
- **Privacy**: Aggregated data only, no individual profiling
- **Accountability**: Human oversight required for all deployment decisions
- **Community Impact**: Focus on prevention, not surveillance
